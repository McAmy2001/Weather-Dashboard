# Bootcamp Module 6: Server Side APIs, Challenge: Weather Dashboard

## This week's project is a Weather Dashboard built from scratch which displays the current and forecasted weather of the city(ies) the user searches for. Data for the dashboard is obtained from the Open Weather API.

### This project went fairly smoothly. My console.log got a major workout as I mined for the data I needed and verified that I was using the right words to display the particular data items required. I found the API interactions to be quite straightforward once I 'got' the structure of the response. Displaying it the way I wanted was not so straightforward. Sometimes in my hubris I think I have a pretty good grasp on CSS. Then I spend an hour trying to move one small element to the place I want it to be. C'est la vie, I guess.

### My Weather Dashboard was built using [Git Hub Pages](https://mcamy2001.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/).

#### I received help from my TA Lexie Crawford for displaying the weather icons. I also did many (many!)googles in the course of this project, but there was no one site that played a major role in this project.

##### For this class assignment a Table of Contents, Installation Instructions, Usage Information, Credits, License Information, Badges, Features, and Tests are not necessary but I'd like to acknowledge that those would be included here when pertinent.
